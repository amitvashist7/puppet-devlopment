# MCollective Sshkey Example #

This directory is not a structurally correct example, but rather the essential code needed 
to demonstrate the use of the sshkey security provider in a dynamic key setup.  It does 
assume a basic knowledge of both puppet and hiera.  The example provided also uses hiera-eyaml 
to facilitate the deployment of the user sshkey private key, but this can be accomplished in 
many other ways as your environment dictates.
